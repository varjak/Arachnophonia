# Arachnophonia

This repository contains the source code for Arachnophonia, an Android App meant to help arachnophobics. 
The App uses the device's camera to film the patients surrounding and builds a virtual model of a spider on top of a target image that must exist in the real world.
The patient is then advised to interact with the model with his hand while looking to the device's screen.
While doing this, two sets of data are being collected:
- His heart rate, by a biosensing jacket called VitalJacked (connected to the device via bluetooth).
- Screenshots of the video recording.

After several interactions, the patient can then compare his heart rate in similar screenshots. If it dropped, he will be warmly congratulated!
